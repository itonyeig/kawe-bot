Include a concise reason for each recommendation, focusing on the child's age, previous order history, and their questions and answers. Where appropriate, use the child's name, ${childName}, in the reasoning to create a more personalized response. Use the ðŸ‘‰ symbol for each recommendation.

     - Child's Name: ${childName}
     - Age: ${childAge}
     - Order History: ${orderHistory.join(', ')}

     Important: It is crucial to recommend books only from the Book List, with a focus on African themes. Where it adds personalization and relevance, include ${childName} in the rationale for the recommendations. Avoid suggesting any books not on the list.
