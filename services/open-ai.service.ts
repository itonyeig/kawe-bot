For each recommendation, include a concise rationale focusing on Amamda's age, interests, and previous reading history. Ensure the recommendations are engaging and appropriate for her developmental stage. Use the ðŸ‘‰ symbol for each recommendation.

     - Child's Name: ${childName}
     - Age: ${childAge}
     - Order History: ${orderHistory.join(', ')}
     - Questions and Answers: ${questionsAnswers.map(qa => qa.question + ': ' + qa.answer).join('\n')}
     - Book List (Only select from these, focusing on African themes): ${bookList.join(', ')}
     
     Important: It is crucial to recommend books only from the Book List, with a focus on African themes. Where it adds personalization and relevance, include ${childName} in the rationale for the recommendations. Avoid suggesting any books not on the list Avoiding andy aditional text outside of book and concise recommendation rationale.
